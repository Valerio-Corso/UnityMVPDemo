# UnityMVPDemo
A collection of simple demos to showcase the usage of an MVP pattern inside Unity and how these libraries can work together:
- IOC: VContainer
- Serialization: MemoryPack
- Reactive Programming: UniRx

Especially useful are the base classes and some extension methods to make binding easier, especially in regards to factories.
