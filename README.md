# UnityMVPDemo
A collection of simple demo to showcase the usage of an MVP pattern inside Unity, libraries used:
- IOC: VContainer
- Serialization: MemoryPack
- Reactive Programming: UniRx

Especially useful are the base classes and my approach and some extension methods to make binding easier, especially in regards to factories.
